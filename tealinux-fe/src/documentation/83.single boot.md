## Steps to Install TeaLinuxOS in Single Boot Mode

1. **Boot from the Installation Media**  
   Insert your TeaLinuxOS installation USB or DVD and reboot your system.  
   You may need to access your BIOS/UEFI to set the boot priority so that it loads from the USB or DVD first.

2. **Choose Installation Type**  
   On the installation screen, select the **"Single Boot"** option.  
   This will erase all existing data on your selected disk and install TeaLinuxOS as the only OS.

   You’ll also be able to select the file system type here — common choices include:

   - **EXT4**: Stable and widely supported.
   - **BTRFS**: Modern filesystem with snapshot and rollback support.

3. **Confirm Data Erasure**  
 The installer will notify you that all data on the disk will be permanently deleted.  
 Make sure you’ve backed up any important files before continuing.
