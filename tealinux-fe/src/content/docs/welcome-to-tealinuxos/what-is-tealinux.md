# What is TeaLinux?

**TeaLinuxOS** is a Linux distribution based on **Arch Linux**, developed by the *Dinus Open Source Community (DOSCOM)*. It is crafted with a strong focus on programming and development, providing a clean and efficient environment for developers.

Earlier versions of TeaLinuxOS used **Calamares** as its default installer, known for its ease of use and graphical interface. As the project evolved to adopt the Arch base, the installation method was refined to embrace more flexibility and user control — aligning with Arch’s minimalist and DIY philosophy.

TeaLinuxOS carries the philosophy: <i>“Nikmatnya Sebuah Racikan”</i>, which roughly translates to **"The Delight of a Well-Crafted Blend"**. Just like a cup of tea made from carefully chosen ingredients, TeaLinuxOS blends the stability and power of Arch Linux with thoughtfully selected development tools, aiming to deliver a system that is not only powerful but also pleasant and inspiring to use.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, TeaLinuxOS offers a balance of simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency — an operating system brewed to match your coding journey.
