# What's New

TeaLinuxOS is now built on top of Arch Linux, marking a significant shift from its previous versions that were based on Xubuntu.

In earlier releases, TeaLinuxOS utilized Xubuntu for its stability and ease of use, especially aimed at beginners. However, to better meet the needs of more advanced users and offer greater flexibility in development, TeaLinuxOS has transitioned to Arch Linux as its system foundation.

Additionally, the desktop environment has also evolved — moving from the lightweight XFCE in previous versions to more modern and feature-rich options like Cosmic and KDE. This change delivers a more engaging and productive user experience.

As part of its latest innovations, TeaLinuxOS now introduces the Tea Installer, a new installation tool built using the Rust programming language. With its high performance and improved memory safety, Tea Installer ensures a fast, stable, and secure installation process for all users.
